<em>
"In computer programming, unit testing is a procedure used to validate that individual units of source code 
are working properly. A <tt>unit</tt> is the smallest testable part of an application. 
In procedural programming a unit may be an individual program, function, procedure, etc., 
while in object-oriented programming, the smallest unit is a method; which may belong to a base/super class, 
abstract class or derived/child class."\n

If you are new to the unit testing world, please take a minute to read the
<a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/test/doc/html/utf/tutorials.html">hello testing tutorials</a>
of the <a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/test">Boost Test Library</a>   

So, now we must agree that <b>we need to test while developing</b>, right? \n
For this reason ImagePlus has a validation (or test) system based on the 
<a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/test">Boost Test Library</a> to:
- simplify tests addition
- simplify tests development
- create template and parametric tests
- run desired tests in build-time
- use test data in a uniformed path

\todo how to test?
