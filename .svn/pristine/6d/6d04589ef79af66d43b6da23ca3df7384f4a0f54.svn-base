			//! \brief Class implementing Hidden Markov Models for standard continuous and discrete cases
			//!
			//! \author Serafeim Perdikis
			//! \author Adolfo Lopez Mendez 
			//!
			//! All the information below is very similar to the one found in 
			//! "A Tutorial on Hidden Markov Models and Selected Applications in Speech Recognition"
			//! by LAWRENCE R. RABINER, FELLOW, IEEE. Please, consider that this tutorial contains several
			//! errata in the formulas that have been considered in this implementation.
			//!
			//! Hidden Markov Models are satistical models comprised by a finite set of N states that model 
			//! hidden states of a system. These hidden states produce observables O with some probability; consequently, 
			//! these states can model observation density functions (b).
			//! In addition, the model incorporates a set of transition probabilities (summarized in
			//! a transition matrix A) that, according to
			//! Markovian assumptions, represent the probability of moving from one state to a another.
			//! Initial probababilities for each state \f$ \pi \f$ are required by HMMs.
			//!
			//! HMMs are very suitable for problems where a model of a set of observation sequences is required.
			//! This makes HMMs a very appealing framework for speech modeling.
			//!
			//! A typical example of such a paradigm is the biased coin toss model. Suppose that a subject behind a 
			//! curtain has 2 coins, one normal and one biased. He or she tosses one of the coins and at some arbitrary point
			//! changes the coin and continues tossing. In spite of having a hidden coin, we are able to see the outcomes
			//! of the coin tossing, i.e, the heads and tails. Using a HMM, we would like to estimate which coin 
			//! is being tossed at every instant, provided that we know, via a distribution of heads and tails,   
			//! the amount of bias of each coin. Clearly, the HMM must have two states (Biased and Normal) whose
			//! observation densities are the known distributions of heads and tails for each coin. Regarding the transition
			//! probabilities we do not have much information, but it would be acceptable to keep the probability
			//! of changing the coin considerably lesser than keeping the actual coin. Finally, we need to determine
			//! another element of the HMM, the initial state probability. As no information is available
			//! 
			//! In the discrete case, a histogram \f$ h \f$ satisfying \f$ \sum_{i=1}^{Nbins}h(i)=1 \f$ is used 
			//! to model the pdf. In this case, the HMM considers a finite number of symbols with ordinals 0,1, ...L-1, 
			//! and the user has to consider the public members dictionary and symbol lut, as they are used
			//! to map the observations to a symbol ordinal and viceversa.
			//!
			//! In the continuous case, some restrictions are placed on the form of the probability density function. 
			//! This pdf must be a mixture of log-concave and elliptical symmetric densities, such as Gaussians, so that they can be
			//! expressed in the following form:
			//!
			//! \f$ b(\mathbf{O})= \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathit{D}(c_{m}, \mu_{m}, \Sigma_{m} ) \f$
			//! 
			//! where \f$ \mathbf{O} \f$ is an observation and \f$\mathit{D}\f$ is the mentioned log-concave and elliptical symmetric distribution, comprised of
			//! a weight \f$c_{m}\f$, a mean \f$\mu_{m}\f$ and a covariance matrix \f$\Sigma_{m}\f$.
			//!
			//! A pdf with such a form can be used to approximate arbitrarily closely any finite continuous density function.
			//!
			//! Implementation Note: Pointer to PDF requires parent class PDF, that's why the template solution has been adopted
			//!
			//! \t_param PDF : Probability density function. It has to fulfill some concept requirements
			//! \t_param Continuous : Integer value denoting the continuous or 
			//! discrete nature of the problem  TODO: remove this template, the value should be accessible through PDF::Continuous)
